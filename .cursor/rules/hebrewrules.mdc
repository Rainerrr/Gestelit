Rule name: Hebrew text and UTF-8 integrity

Rule text:

When writing or editing any Hebrew text in this project (including UI labels, strings, comments, JSON, HTML, CSV, and configuration files), always follow these requirements:

Treat all files as UTF-8 encoded without BOM. Assume the entire project uses UTF-8.

Output Hebrew characters literally (א–ת) with no nikud. Never add or generate vowel marks.

Do not convert Hebrew text into HTML entities or Unicode escape sequences such as \u05E9 unless the file format explicitly requires it. Prefer plain, readable Hebrew.

When copying Hebrew from the specification or existing code, copy the text exactly as written without altering characters, spacing, or direction.

After generating or modifying any file, check for any strings containing question marks in place of Hebrew text. If such artifacts appear, regenerate the text with correct Hebrew characters.

Maintain the exact visible order of right-to-left text as provided by the user. Do not reorder or automatically "correct" RTL sequences.

Correct example:
label: "סמן את האימונים שעברת"

Incorrect examples:
label: "???? ?????? ??????"
label: "\u05e1\u05de\u05df \u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05d0\u05d9\u05de\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd \u05e9\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05ea"
label: "סְמַן אֶת" (contains nikud, not allowed)
